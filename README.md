## The General Assembly X-Files Lab from the start of Unit 2

It's important to note, I have added the directory `/node-modules` to gitignore for this
If you clone it, you are going to need to `npm install` some stuff, the instructions for that are in the code comments
1. Express
2. Nodemon (well technically you dont need this)
3. Minimist
